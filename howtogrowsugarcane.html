            <h1> <br><span>HOW TO Grow SUGARCANE</span> <br></h1>
            <p class="par">The best soil for growing sugar cane is one-meter-deep moist,
                 not waterlogged, soil. To grow sugar cane, the ground must be well aerated, 
                 which means that after a heavy rain, its pores are filled with air by more than 10% Sugarcane.
                  Land & Water. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.Commercial sugarcane is planted from
                   stalk cuttings and placed in furrows five feet apart. After approximately 12 months, the mature sugarcane is ready 
                   for harvest. Growers average four harvests from a single planting. The harvesting campaign begins in mid-October and 
                   runs through mid-March or approximately 150 days.In India harvesting of sugarcane is carried out at 10 to 18 months stage, 
                   depending upon the planting time and crop maturity. In sub-tropics, autumn crop is harvested at 15 month stage, whereas spring
                    and summer (late-planted) crops at 10-12 months.</p>
