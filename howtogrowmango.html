            <p class="par">Choose a good location for your tree.<br>
                Dig out a hole about twice as wide as the root ball.<br>
                Place the seedling in the hole.<br>
                Wait until the seedling grows its first pair of leaves.<br>
                When the tree reaches 1 foot tall, you can transplant it into a larger container.<br>
                Like many fruiting trees, mango trees can take quite some time before they start producing fruit.
                 When started from seed, mango trees can take up to 10 years (or longer) until they are mature enough 
                 to produce edible fruit.You can start a mango tree from the seed inside the fruit or buy a grafted tree,
                  which is much more likely to grow fruit, although it does take several years and the right growing conditions.
                   How long does it take to grow a mango seed? It takes a few months to grow a small mango plant from seed..</p>
