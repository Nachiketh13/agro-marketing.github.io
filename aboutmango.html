            <p class="par">A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica.
                 It is believed to have originated in southern Asia, particularly in eastern India, Bangladesh, 
                 and the Andaman Islands.[1] M. indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient
                  times resulting in two types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type".[2][3] 
                  Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits 
                that are also called "mangoes", the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.
                Mango is rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, and it has been associated with many health benefits, including
                 potential anticancer effects, as well as improved immunity and digestive and eye health. Best of all, it's tasty and easy 
                 to add to your diet as part of smoothies and many other dishes.Mango is the national fruit of India which is loved by one and all.
                  It is a very juicy, pulpy and luscious fruit. Ripe mangoes can either be consumed raw or in the form of salad, juice, jams, milkshake or pickles.
                   Mango is a rich source of various vitamins and minerals.</p>
