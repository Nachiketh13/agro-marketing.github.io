            <h1> <br><span>ABOUT RICE</span> <br></h1>
            <p class="par">The rice plant is a member of Poaceae (old Gramineae) family.
                The common cultivated rice plant is an annual which usually grows to a height 
                of a half meter or two meters but there are certain varieties that grow much taller (6-9 metres).<BR>
                As a complex carb, it is the primary source of energy for over half of the world's people. Depending
                 on the strain of rice, it can contain decent amounts of fibre, protein, vitamin B, iron and manganese.
                  This means it can play a vital role against malnutrition. In some cultures, rice is thrown at weddings.
                  Rice is a Kharif crop that requires high temperatures (above 25 Â°C) and high humidity. It requires an annual 
                  rainfall above 100 cm. In areas with less rainfall, it grows with the help of irrigation. Rice is grown in the
                   plains of north and north-eastern India, coastal areas and the deltaic regions.</p>
