            <p class="par">Planting is usually done in the month of July-August in rainfed areas and during February-March in
                 irrigated areas. In case of heavy rainfall zones, planting is taken up at the end of rainy season.
                 The best time to plant a mango tree is in the summer when it's warm, as they like lots of sun [source: California Rare Fruit Growers]. 
                 It helps to start growing the mango tree indoors and to re-plant it outdoors after it begins to sprout.
                 Mangoes are usually available in the summer season. Their colour is changed from green to yellow in most cases as a sign of ripening. Also,
                  they grow bigger in the summer season and get ready to be eaten.</p>
