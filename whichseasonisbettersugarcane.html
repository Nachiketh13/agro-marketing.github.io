            <p class="par">The normal planting season is October-December. Delay
                 in planting reduces cane yield. Planting should not be delayed beyond
                  February in the plains. In hilly tracts where sugarcane is cultivated under rain
                   fed conditions, planting should be done after abatement of heavy rains.Sugarcane take generally 
                   one year to mature in subtropical states of U.P., Punjab, Haryana, Bihar etc. Depending upon the variety 
                   and sowing time it takes about 12 to 18 months to mature. In general January to March is the period of planting
                    and December to March is the period of harvesting.</p>
